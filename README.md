# Data Science & Big Data Analytics (dsbda) - 2022

## Objective
The goal of the project is to study the **Steam platform gaming community** using both standard python, and Big Data tools.<br>
More specifically, considering the users' reviews the objective is to understand, with the statement of some hypotesis, relevant correlation about the *players behavior* (e.g., identify factors such that a player like a video game, if the user is loyal to the same genre, ...).

## Procedure
The stated hypothesis have firstly been studied using a small portion of the overall Big Data source (obtained using snippet of code written with Big Data tools).<br>
Once seen if the selected hypotesis are statistically significant using the small portion of data, the same hypotesis were replicated on the whole data source (using Spark/HDFS/...) and checked if still relevant.

## Datasets
The used datasets (Kaggle) are the following ones:
 - *Reviews data*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/forgemaster/steam-reviews-dataset
 - *Games data*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games
